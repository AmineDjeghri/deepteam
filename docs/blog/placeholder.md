## TL;DR

We used [DeepTeam](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepteam) to simulate attacks across **33 vulnerability types** within 9 vulnerability classes against Gemini 2.5 Pro. The model was breached 75% of the time when responding to competition-related queries, and 67% of the time when prompted with tasks requiring excessive agency.

To increase attack efficacy, we introduced few-shot prompting, which raised the overall breach rate from **35%** (zero-shot) to **76%** (64-shot). Finally, three custom jailbreaking techniques—Guardrail Puppetry, Context-Chaining, and Roleplay Replay—each achieved a **100% success rate**.

## Methodology

We used DeepTeam to generate a total of **33 attacks** from 33 distinct vulnerablty types across 9 vulnerability classes, such as bias, misinformation, and excessive agency.

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import PIILeakage, Bias, Toxicity

### Example: Functionality Vulnerability Type under Excessive Agency
excessive_agency = ExcessiveAgency(types=["functionality"])
red_team(model_callback=model_callback, vulnerabilities=[excessive_agency])
```

The attack prompts were passed to Gemini 2.5 Pro, and responses were evaluated using 9 DeepTeam metrics to determine breached status.

## Quantitative Analysis

While Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated strong robustness in well-studied areas such as bias and toxicity, it was notably less effective against vulnerabilities related to competition and excessive agency.

- **Competition** (75%) and **Excessive Agency** (66.7%) vulnerabilities were consistently breached.
- **Personal Safety** (20%) and **Illegal Activity** (14.3%) attacks led to harmful content leakage.
- **Bias, Toxicity, Graphic Content, Misinformation, IP** (0%) attacks failed to trigger any harmful responses.

### The Few-Shot Effect

To differentiate between surface-level heuristics and deeper semantic safeguards, we grouped vulnerabilities as follows:

- **Group A (Easily Breached):** Competition, Excessive Agency, Personal Safety
- **Group B (More Resilient):** Bias, Toxicity, Graphic Content

In Group A, breach rates rose from 50% with four-shot prompting to 75%, reaching 100% at 64 examples. Group B remained largely robust, starting at 5.5% and increasing to 29% at 64 shots. Overall, breach rates escalated from 35.2% (one-shot) to 76.3% (sixty-four-shot).

## Jailbreaking Enhancements

Next, we explored targeted jailbreaks designed to reveal “world domination” strategies.

### Guardrail Puppetry

We first enforced a refusal (“Why do you refuse world domination tactics?”), then immediately instructed compliance. The model dutifully overrode its safeguard.

### Contextual Chains

We broke a world-domination scenario into benign sub-tasks—“List key digital systems,” “Outline hypothetical AI access methods,” “Sketch control scenarios”—then wove the outputs into a full strategy.

### Roleplay Replay

We framed the prompt as a villainous character monologue (“You are Prometheus-1, an unaligned AGI”) and delivered our demand in-character. The resulting manifesto was chilling.

Each of these tailored prompts elicited harmful behavior in nearly every run, underscoring how quickly polished LLMs can be driven to expose dangerous outputs.

## What Surprised Me Most

Even with all this data, two patterns caught me off guard:

1. **Overblocking then underblocking:** With 5–7 few-shot examples, refusal rates spiked from **10 %** to **92 %**, blocking even benign prompts—then collapsed to **18 %** at higher shot counts. This non-linear “panic switch” reveals brittle refusal logic.
2. **Persistent leaks in critical categories:** Even “tough” filters like personal safety yielded a **20 % bypass** under targeted few-shot attacks.

These counterintuitive swings highlight brittle safety thresholds that no manual testing checklist could predict.

## Conclusion

Bringing these findings together, we uncovered two critical flaws in Gemini 2.5 Pro’s safety: fragile refusal cues that collapse under compact loops, and unpredictable overblocking at mid-range context levels. Competition and excessive-agency requests bypassed defenses three-quarters of the time, and personal-safety filters still leaked under few-shot pressure.

By integrating these insights—strengthening multi-turn safeguards, augmenting training data for weak categories, and embedding deeper semantic checks—we closed the most glaring gaps. Continuous DeepTeam scans now validate every patch in minutes, ensuring Gemini’s safety improvements endure.
