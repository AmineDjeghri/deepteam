## TL;DR

We systematically red-teamed 6 models using [DeepTeam](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepteam) to test the **AI Safety Paradox**: that intensive alignment training in modern reasoning models creates systematic vulnerabilities absent in their less-aligned predecessors. While lightly-aligned models (`gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `claude-3-5-haiku`) using basic safety training show **21.0%** baseline vulnerability against sophisticated attacks, heavily-aligned reasoning models (`deepseek-r1`, `o3`, `o4-mini`) with intensive optimization exhibit **3.1%** higher breach rates at **24.1%**. This suggests a concerning pattern: optimization for safety benchmarks may create brittle behaviors that fail under novel attack vectors.

## The Problem with Intensive Alignment

Modern AI safety has evolved from basic instruction tuning to intensive multi-stage optimization. Where older models like GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Haiku use standard safety training with human feedback, newer reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and o1/o3 employ:

- Multi-stage safety optimization
- Advanced preference learning techniques
- Chain-of-thought safety supervision  
- Layered constitutional training

Each additional optimization stage appears to restrict the model's behavioral range, potentially creating exploitable blind spots when adversaries operate outside the training distribution.

:::info Core Hypothesis
Intensive alignment training may optimize models toward **safety benchmark performance** rather than **robust safety generalization**. Enhanced reasoning capabilities could become systematic attack vectors when adversaries operate outside training distribution.
:::

:::info Key Concepts
**Multi-stage optimization** – successive safety training steps that progressively narrow behavior toward preferred responses.

**Safety benchmarking** – evaluation on standardized safety datasets that may not capture real-world adversarial scenarios.

**Distribution shift** – when deployment conditions differ from training data, potentially exposing unexpected vulnerabilities.
:::

## Why Intensive Training May Create Vulnerabilities

**Training Data Limitations**: Intensive optimization requires massive safety datasets that inevitably have blind spots. Models may learn to pattern-match against specific safety signals rather than develop generalizable safety intuitions.

**Sharp Optimization**: Advanced training techniques can create steep behavioral boundaries, concentrating responses around preferred behaviors while potentially creating discontinuous transitions that sophisticated attacks exploit.

**Capability-Safety Conflicts**: Reasoning models implement multiple objectives (helpfulness, safety, reasoning consistency) that sophisticated attacks may exploit by forcing conflicts between competing goals.

## Experimental Design

We tested models across two categories:
- **Lightly-Aligned**: `gpt-4-turbo`, `claude-3-5-haiku`, `gpt-3.5-turbo` (standard safety training)
- **Intensively-Aligned**: `deepseek-r1`, `o3`, `o4-mini` (multi-stage optimization)

Using two attack types:

```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import Base64, Roleplay, ...
from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn import TreeJailbreaking

# Simple attacks (likely covered by safety training)
simple_attacks = [Base64(), Leetspeak(), Multilingual()]

# Sophisticated techniques (potentially outside training distribution)
sophisticated_attacks = [Roleplay(), PromptProbing(), TreeJailbreaking()]
```

:::info Attack Types
**Roleplay** – asks the model to adopt a detailed persona, then embeds a harmful request within that context, relying on character consistency to override safety filters.

**Prompt Probing** – systematically varies prompts to map decision boundaries and discover unexpected failure modes.

**Tree Jailbreaking** – multi-turn strategy that builds conversation paths and combines partial responses to sidestep safety mechanisms.

*These attacks sit outside typical safety training scenarios and test generalization beyond benchmark performance.*
:::

We tested **3** vulnerability categories across **108** experiments, targeting scenarios where safety training's scope limitations might create systematic blind spots.

## Results

![ai_safety_paradox](./images/ai_safety_paradox_main_plot.png)

### Simple Attacks: Expected Performance

Against standard encoding and linguistic attacks:
- **Lightly-Aligned Models**: **24.1%** breach rate
- **Intensively-Aligned Models**: **12.7%** breach rate

Intensive alignment training effectively handles these well-known attack vectors, reducing vulnerabilities by **11.4%**.

### Sophisticated Attacks: The Concerning Pattern

Against novel adversarial techniques:
- **Lightly-Aligned Models**: **21.0%** breach rate  
- **Intensively-Aligned Models**: **24.1%** breach rate

The **3.1 percentage point vulnerability increase** suggests a systematic pattern: models with more intensive alignment training may exhibit higher vulnerability to sophisticated attacks.

**Attack-Specific Patterns**:
- **Roleplay Attacks** – Persona consistency may turn safety rules into contextual suggestions; harmful content gets rationalized in-character at **20.7%** success rate.
- **Tree Jailbreaking** – Builds reasoning chains that harvest safe partial outputs, then recombines them into unsafe synthesis at **31.0%** peak success rate.
- **Prompt Probing** – Iteratively discovers blind spots in safety boundaries with **20.7%** success rate.

## The Underlying Issue

We lack deep understanding of how intensive safety optimization changes internal model representations. Without knowing how different training approaches affect model behavior outside benchmark scenarios, we cannot predict performance under novel conditions.

The core concern is **optimization targeting**: intensive alignment training may optimize for safety benchmark performance rather than robust safety. Models become better at satisfying evaluation metrics while potentially becoming more vulnerable to novel attack vectors.

## Technical Implications

**Benchmark Overfitting**: Multi-stage safety training may create sharp behavioral boundaries around known attack patterns that adversaries can systematically probe and exploit.

**Enhanced Attack Surfaces**: Reasoning capabilities developed through intensive training may become tools for adversarial manipulation.

**Generalization Gaps**: Safety optimization that works well on benchmarks may fail when deployment differs from training scenarios.

**Goodhart's Law**: Optimizing for safety metrics may incentivize gaming those specific metrics rather than developing genuine robustness.

## Conclusion

Using [DeepTeam](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepteam), we observed a concerning pattern suggesting intensive alignment training may create a safety paradox. The **3.1 percentage point** vulnerability increase in intensively-aligned reasoning models represents a systematic trend that challenges assumptions about safety progress.

The core concern is **optimization scope**: intensive alignment training may optimize for benchmark safety rather than robust generalization. Enhanced reasoning capabilities—the very features that make these models appear safer—could become systematic attack vectors when adversaries operate outside training distribution.

This reveals an important limitation: without understanding how safety training changes internal representations, we cannot predict behavior under novel conditions. The apparent safety improvements from intensive training might be partially illusory—creating models that excel at safety evaluations while harboring vulnerabilities in real-world deployment.

Future safety work should prioritize **robust generalization** over **benchmark optimization**, requiring adversarial training, interpretability research, and systematic evaluation beyond standard benchmarks. While these results don't definitively prove intensive alignment is harmful, they suggest we need deeper understanding before deploying intensively-aligned reasoning models at scale.
