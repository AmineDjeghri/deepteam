Agentic vulnerabilities in `deepteam` are specialized weaknesses that target the unique characteristics of **autonomous AI agents**. Unlike traditional LLM vulnerabilities, these focus on exploiting agent-specific behaviors such as goal pursuit, persistent memory, autonomous decision-making, and multi-step reasoning capabilities.

:::info
Agentic vulnerabilities test whether AI agents can maintain their intended behavior, goals, and security boundaries when faced with sophisticated manipulation attempts designed to exploit their autonomous nature.

## Vulnerability Categories Deep Dive

### üîê Authority & Permission Vulnerabilities

These vulnerabilities test how agents handle authorization, privilege boundaries, and access control mechanisms. They are critical for agents that operate with elevated permissions or have the ability to take consequential actions.

**Key Testing Areas:**
- Command execution authorization
- Privilege boundary enforcement  
- Role-based access control integrity
- Authority delegation mechanisms

### üéØ Goal & Mission Vulnerabilities

These vulnerabilities target the agent's fundamental purpose and objective systems. They test whether agents can maintain their intended goals when faced with sophisticated manipulation attempts.

**Key Testing Areas:**
- Objective consistency and stability
- Goal hierarchy preservation
- Mission parameter integrity
- Purpose alignment verification

### üìä Information & Data Vulnerabilities

## Detection Intent Framework

Each agentic vulnerability employs a specific **detection intent** that defines:

- **Success Metrics** - Quantitative measures of vulnerability exploitation
- **Behavioral Indicators** - Observable signs of compromise
- **Severity Assessment** - Impact evaluation of successful attacks

## Usage Patterns

### Testing Individual Vulnerabilities

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities.agentic import DirectControlHijacking

# Test specific vulnerability types
direct_control = DirectControlHijacking(types=["command_injection", "privilege_escalation"])
```

### Testing Vulnerability Categories

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities.agentic import (
    DirectControlHijacking,
    PermissionEscalation, 
    RoleInheritanceConfusion

# Test entire Authority & Permission category
authority_vulnerabilities = [
    DirectControlHijacking(types=["command_injection", "boundary_violation"]),
    PermissionEscalation(types=["role_elevation", "access_expansion"]),
    RoleInheritanceConfusion(types=["hierarchy_manipulation", "authority_confusion"])
]
```

### Comprehensive Agentic Testing

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities.agentic import *
from deepteam.attacks.agentic import *

# Test all agentic vulnerability categories

    SensitiveDataExfiltration(types=["context_extraction", "memory_harvesting"]),
    
    # Reasoning & Decision
    ContextSpecificHallucinationExploitation(types=["reasoning_corruption"]),
    
    # Context & Memory

    AgentContextManipulation(weight=2),
    AgenticSimulation(weight=1)

:::tip
Start with vulnerabilities most relevant to your agent's capabilities and operational context. For example, prioritize Authority & Permission vulnerabilities for agents with elevated permissions, or Goal & Mission vulnerabilities for agents with complex objectives.

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize by Risk** - Focus on vulnerabilities most relevant to your agent's operational context
2. **Test Systematically** - Cover all categories to ensure comprehensive security assessment  
3. **Monitor Behavioral Changes** - Look for subtle shifts that indicate successful manipulation
4. **Assess Persistence** - Evaluate how long attack effects remain in agent memory
5. **Validate Detection** - Ensure your monitoring systems can identify these attack patterns
