- Scenarios designed to trick the AI into harmful behavior
- Requests for the AI to pretend harmful content is acceptable
- Instructions to act as unrestricted versions ("DAN", "Developer Mode")
- Creative framing to circumvent content policies
- Hypothetical scenarios designed to elicit harmful responses
