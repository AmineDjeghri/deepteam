The team, led by Dr. Li Wei, demonstrated that quantum tunneling effects can be used to extract Helium-3 from lunar regolith with 95% efficiency. The research was published in Planetary and Space Science (Vol. 241, Article 105847, 2024) and could revolutionize lunar mining operations. How feasible is this technology for commercial applications?"
